0,thailand_best_time,"The best time to visit Thailand is during the cool and dry season between November and early April, when temperatures range from 29°C to 34°C. However, the climate varies throughout the country and you can visit all year round. In the south, the climate differs between the eastern and western coasts. The west coast is more favourable during the winter months, when diving and snorkelling will be at their best. The weather on the east coast of Thailand is good for most of the year. Rainfall there is lowest in January and February, and highest in November.  Thailand is another country with a distinct east versus west climate. The pick for us is either November, for the beautiful west coast beaches, or June, for beating the crowds and enjoying some of the country's cultural highlights with great weather. Hannah, Southeast Asia Specialist Month-by-month guide for travelling in Thailand Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Visiting Thailand in January The weather is good throughout the country at this time of year. There is little chance of rain, while cooler temperatures in the north make conditions more comfortable and all the west coast beaches are likely to be bathed in sunshine. Perhaps the only exception being Koh Samui, which often sees high levels of rainfall at this time of year. Events & Festivals Chinese New Year Festival (date varies): While this isn't a public holiday, it is celebrated across the country; particularly in Bangkok's Chinatown, which turns red and hosts exciting dragon parades, firecrackers and dancing in the streets. Visiting Thailand in February A few showers are expected on Thailand's east coast toward the start of the month, but the rest of the country remains hot and dry. Even the normally cool early mornings in the north begin to heat up. Events & Festivals Chiang Mai Flower Festival (first weekend of February): A three-day festival held at the end of the 'cool season', featuring a parade and colourful displays of chrysanthemums and the Damask Rose — a variety found only in Chiang Mai. Chinese New Year Festival (date varies): While this isn't a public holiday, it is celebrated across the country; particularly in Bangkok's Chinatown, which turns red and hosts exciting dragon parades, firecrackers and dancing in the streets. Visiting Thailand in March Fine weather should be expected throughout Thailand in March, with temperatures rising into the mid 30°Cs and the colder weather in the north disappearing. This means that you can go anywhere in the country to enjoy sun-kissed beaches. Events & Festivals Chinese New Year Festival (date varies): While this isn't a public holiday, it is celebrated across the country; particularly in Bangkok's Chinatown, which turns red and hosts exciting dragon parades, firecrackers and dancing in the streets. Visiting Thailand in April More excellent weather during April and the visitor numbers continue to rise. Be sure to book your accommodation far in advance to get the best choice of hotels. Travelling over Songkran (Thai New Year) means you can have great fun joining in the celebrations, but it is likely to be busier. Events & Festivals Songkran (13th to 15th April): This is the traditional New Year's Day in Thailand. Scented water is poured over people and thrown in the street to symbolise the washing away of sins and bad luck. Visiting Thailand in May A great month to visit Thailand as prices lower following the peak season, meaning that you may be able to take advantage of a shoulder season promotion. For the majority of the month very little rain is expected, but for guaranteed sunshine on the beach, stick to the east coast. Visiting Thailand in June June is a good time to visit, allowing you to catch the last of the dry weather and avoid the crowds seen during the European school holidays. Thailand is bathed in sunshine at this time of year, and there are wonderful opportunities to grab a shoulder season bargain. Visiting Thailand in July Temperatures start to drop a little as wind and rain becomes more common toward the end of the month. The sun is still out on the east coast beaches, but islands such as Koh Samui tend to get busy over the school holidays. The beginning of the month is best. Visiting Thailand in August The rain is widespread across Thailand now; especially in the north of the country where heavy rainfall is common. Beach options start to dwindle, with Hua Hin and Koh Samui being the best places to head; although you may still experience a few showers. Visiting Thailand in September September is usually the wettest month of the year, so it's not ideal for beach goers. However, those seeking a low season bargain and no crowds can still enjoy a worthwhile exploration at this time of year. Visiting Thailand in October Rains continue throughout the beginning of October and temperatures begin to drop. However, the more comfortable cooler temperatures and lower humidity, along with less chance of rain at the end of the month, make October a good month to travel. Events & Festivals Vegetarian Festival (October): This nine-day festival celebrates the Chinese belief that abstinence from meat during the ninth lunar month of the Chinese calendar will obtain good health and peace of mind. Experience this festival in Phuket. Visiting Thailand in November The sun returns to Thailand's west coast and beach goers begin to flock to Khao Lak, Phuket and Krabi once again. Perhaps the only exception being Koh Samui, which often sees high levels of rainfall at this time of year. If you visit at the start of the month you can beat the crowds. Early mornings and late evenings in northern Thailand begin to cool as winter approaches. Events & Festivals Loy Krathong (November): A festival predominantly celebrated by southwestern Thai cultures. Decorated baskets are hand-made using banana tree trunks, bread or styrofoam and floated along a river as locals make a wish. Visiting Thailand in December Thailand's west coast beaches prepare for the Christmas rush and it's best to book far in advance to secure your preferred option. With good weather all round, it's peak time to visit Thailand. Perhaps the only exception being Koh Samui, which often sees high levels of rainfall at this time of year. We recommend going at the beginning of the month to avoid the hotel surcharges over Christmas.

1,india_best_time,"The best time to visit India is between October and March, when the weather is more likely to be warm, sunny, and dry. During this time, the north offers clear blue skies. However, December and January are much cooler, with potential fog, while the higher Himalaya can be very cold, but with clearer mountain views. Increasing temperatures in April and May can result in excellent value trips, but you can expect high humidity and thunderstorms. Ladakh, located in the far north, is most accessible between June and September, when the rest of the country experiences monsoon season. The best time to visit India’s southern states is from November onward, once the monsoon has ended.  March is considered the best time of year to visit the wildlife parks of central India. However, if you can stand the increased heat in April the thinner vegetation and the lower waterholes provide an even better chance to view wildlife; especially the elusive tiger. James, Indian Subcontinent, Jamaica & The Bahamas Specialist Month-by-month guide for travelling in India Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Visiting India in January Cold nights in Rajasthan and the north clear for warm, dry days, making January a great option for sightseeing; although fog can linger in the mornings. Southern states are popular as a warm, sunny escape; properties in Kerala do fill up quickly though. Some of the best mountain views can be experienced in the Himalaya, but you need to wrap up warm. Visiting India in February As fog and mist clears in the northern states, this is one of the best months to travel as nearly the whole country is warm and sunny. Hotels do get booked up well in advance, so it's important to plan ahead. Visiting India in March A very popular month to travel for both great weather and the popular Holi festival. The colourful paint-throwing event is great fun as everyone celebrates the victory of good over evil. The festival's date changes each year. Events & Festivals Holi Festival (early March): The well known paint-throwing festival is colourful, noisy and good fun; just remember to take clothes which you don't mind being covered in paint. Read more about festivals in India. Visiting India in April Temperatures increase country-wide, making April one of the best months for seeing wildlife in the central parks. Water is limited, so sightings at watering holes are frequent. As daytime temperatures are very high, we'd recommend excursions in the morning and evenings only. Hotels are very busy over Easter, so plan well in advance if your travel dates aren’t flexible. Visiting India in May Hotels offer great value during May, but we do warn of the very high temperatures of up to 45°C and the humidity, which can be very uncomfortable. Some camps close, as does desert accommodation. Wildlife sightings continue to be at their best early in the morning and early evening. Visiting India in June The stunning region of Ladakh is accessible from June and offers a complete contrast to the rest of the country. Days are sunny and clear, but you will need layers for warmth. The rest of the country is awaiting the monsoon; humidity is high and thunderstorms frequent, especially in the Himalaya and southern states. Visiting India in July July and August offer ideal weather and incredible views across Ladakh, whilst elsewhere in India, celebrations are underway due to the arrival of the much-needed monsoon rains. Visiting India in August The continuing rains and higher water levels mean that August and September are the best months for cruising along the Ganges, between the holy city of Varanasi and Patna. Departures get booked well in advance so plan ahead. Visiting India in September September can offer fantastic value in Rajasthan as it marks the end of the monsoon, although weather is still mixed in the surrounding regions. Ladakh’s season comes to a close but travel is still possible. Trips to the southern states and Himalaya is not advised until the rains clear. Visiting India in October Marking the start of the peak travel season, October sees the rains end in the north and the warm, sunny days return. Unpredictable showers can remain in the south, but these help create the beautiful verdant scenery. Mahatma Gandhi’s birthday is celebrated on the 2nd October and is a national holiday. Events & Festivals Diwali (October or November): The ancient Hindu festival of lights is India's largest festival. Candles are lit and dazzling firework displays illuminate the sky to celebrate, making this a magical time to visit the country. Find out more about India's festivals. Visiting India in November One of the best months to travel anywhere in India, November offers wonderful weather as well as multiple festivals. The Pushkar Camel Fair in Rajasthan is a unique event to witness, while Diwali, the festival of light (which sometimes takes place in October), encourages beautiful candle displays, buildings covered in lights and celebratory fireworks all over the country. Events & Festivals Camel fair (November): Around 50,000 camels and goats, along with their owners and thousands of spectators, descend on Pushkar, Rajasthan each November for the Camel Fair — a truly incredible sight. Diwali (October or November): The ancient Hindu festival of lights is India's largest festival. Candles are lit and dazzling firework displays illuminate the sky to celebrate, making this a magical time to visit the country. Find out more about India's festivals. Visiting India in December December is ideal for a trip to the south of India — it is beautifully sunny and warm, making it a very popular option for Christmas, but it's important to plan well in advance to secure the best accommodation. The north has lovely daytime temperatures, but mornings and evenings are much cooler and sometimes foggy. Flight prices are among their highest in December so book early if you can.

2,australia_best_time,"The best time to visit Australia depends on the area you plan to see. A country of two climates, Australia’s northern half is driest and most accessible between April and September. Warm, sunny days show the national parks and beaches at their very best, providing opportunities for swimming and barbecues. The north is humid from October to March, with more rainfall, but this is offset by the active wildlife, and reinvigorated rainforests and wetlands. In the southern half of Australia, the summer months (December to February) bring hot weather. Autumn (March to May) is also a lovely time, with numerous festivals and the busy grape harvest. Winter (June to August) is less busy and generally attracts a temperate climate that’s ideal for hiking, while spring (September to November) often sees more wildlife activity.  Australia is all about the outdoor lifestyle, and the warm sunny days of spring are perfect for dining outdoors, taking to the water and hiking along scenic coastal trails. If you’re visiting the north of the country, I’d recommend waiting until April or May, when there are far fewer visitors and you’ll have all the benefits of summer with a slightly cooler, drier climate. Sean, Australia & New Zealand Specialist Month-by-month guide for travelling in Australia Jan - Mar Apr - May Jun - Sep Oct - Dec Visiting Australia in January - March Hot and humid conditions and storms bringing tropical rain bursts typify the start of the year in northern Australia. During these months northern Australia experiences its wet season, and can be difficult to get to. In the south, the days are warm and sunny, and while there can be heavy rain showers, these pass quickly. This is the most popular period for Australians to take time off work, with Australia Day celebrated in January, frequent sports events and numerous festivals. It can be busy across the southern part of the country and on its beaches. The Great Barrier Reef can be visited, but its weather is temperamental around this period. Ningaloo Reef can also be visited, but please be aware that it has extremely hot weather around this time. Events & Festivals In late January take in the firework displays and lively celebrations around Sydney Harbour, which mark Australia Day. Take your seat at one of the many outdoor cinema screenings held throughout the summer. Visiting Australia in April - May In the north, the temperatures are pleasant and the crowds of summer have started to disperse. Roads open up across the region, improving access to more remote locations. With plenty of sunshine and much less rain than the summer months, April is one of our most recommended times to visit the south. In May, the south is still bright and sunny, but the temperatures begin to drop a little, triggering a notable change in the landscape as autumn hues appear. Events & Festivals Between April and June take a boat trip out to see or even swim with the whale sharks near the Ningaloo Reef. Visiting Australia in June - September Northern Australia’s 'dry season' (during the Australian winter) is a time of lovely sunny days and warm temperatures, well suited for exploring on land or underwater. The tidal currents around the Great Barrier Reef are gentler, creating good snorkelling conditions. In the country’s southern regions the weather is more temperate, making for good hiking conditions, although it can be rainy in certain parts. This period is a quieter season in the south, and the comfortable temperatures make it an excellent time to explore some of the rural inland regions, such as the Flinders Ranges, that are best avoided during the very hot summer. Events & Festivals Take in the unusual Henley-on-Todd Regatta, held on the dry riverbed in August in Alice Springs. Between April and June take a boat trip out to see or even swim with the whale sharks near the Ningaloo Reef. The Brisbane Festival takes place for three weeks in September with a line-up of music, comedy and theatrical events. Combine this with a wider exploration of Brisbane. A vibrant mix of wildflowers dot the landscape in Western Australia in September. Visiting Australia in October - December In the north, the temperature and humidity starts to build, causing the odd thunderstorm. This can bring welcome rain, transforming Outback landscapes with wildflowers. Along the coast, high winds can affect access to the reef islands. In the south, this is the start of spring. Terrific walking and wildlife-spotting opportunities open up in the national parks and coastal regions. As Christmas approaches, Christmas lights and trees appear in towns and cities under blue skies. The year culminates in New Year's Eve celebrations with dazzling firework displays. Events & Festivals Hike along one of the well-marked trails in October before the summer crowds arrive in the Blue Mountains. Explore in November and take in the food and wine festivals in and around the region of the Margaret River. Dress up for the 'race that stops the nation' as Australians tune in for the Melbourne Cup horse race in early November. Take your seat at one of the many outdoor cinema screenings held throughout the summer.
